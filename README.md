# Tc, the chat client for Twitch :smile: [gettc.xyz](http://gettc.xyz)

![](./src/assets/icon256.png)

Tc is a cross-platform desktop chat client for [Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/).

:warning: Hey there! While Tc is still working right now, the [development has stopped](https://github.com/mccxiv/tc/issues/519). If you've just stumbled upon this, you may want to try some other client instead.

---

### For developers
Running Tc in dev mode *should* be simple. If the instructions below aren't
working then please open an issue.

- Clone the repo
- `npm i`
- In terminal 1: `npm run dev-watch-files`
- In terminal 2, once terminal 1 is done: `npm run dev-launch-electron`

After you edit some files, restart terminal 2 to re-launch electron. No need
to touch terminal 1.
